Instantors Fullstack exercise
=========================
Welcome to Instantors fullstack exercise! This repository right now contains the skeleton of a front-end and back-end.

Goal
----
The goal is to make it an webapp/website that presents information about a specific (or random) Star Wars character. 

Requirements
-----
1. You should not need to change any front-end code to change the character information (if it contains errors).
2. The front-end may not communicate with any third-party resources. 

Character Information
--------
The character information can either be static or for extra credits it can be retrieved from [swapi.co](https://swapi.co) in the back-end.
